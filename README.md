Did Performance Enhance Drugs really affected the league?

From the late ‘80s through the late 2000s, a number of players were believed to have used performance- enhancing drugs (PED) in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a result, offensive outputs such as Home Runs and Runs Batted In were believed to have increased, which also have increased the total runs (R, scores made by the team) and runs allowed (RA, scores made by the opponent team) during the “steroid era”. We are trying to find if there is difference between the average of total scores made (R + RA) for each MLB team between the steroid era (1994 - 2003) and the clean era (2004 - 2013), when MLB office implemented league-wide PED testing in 2004. If using PED was effective for offensive statistics in MLB, new regulations and PED testing from MLB office should reduce the total scores made.
